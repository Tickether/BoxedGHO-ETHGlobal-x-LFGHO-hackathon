Covert GHO & send across any chain into any token using the Box & Smart contract wallet integration

BoxedGHO combines smart contract accounts & the box to embed GHO as payment input and convert to any desired recipient chain/token. The application allows users to top up your GHO balances with fiat using web2 payment gates, after GHO can now be swapped into any token on any chain to any recipient

## How ðŸ“¦BoxedGHO Work ðŸ’¡

- Our team hacked with ZeroDev/Wagmi( Viem ) & ConnectKit for smart account wallet integration with some gasless features. 

- We use the Box from Decent.xyz to help us swap or swap & bridge GHO. 

- The frontend stack is the app router version of the latest Next.js ( 14 ) 

- we use African web2 payment provider Flutterwave to accept fiat payments to top up GHO.
